GTK+ for Windows Runtime Environment Installer
==============================================

This repository is a fork of the  [GTK+ for Windows Runtime Environment Installer](http://gtk-win.sourceforge.net) that was originally created
by Alexander Shaduri.
My efforts here will focus on creating a 64-bit version of the runtime that he has been providing so far, using up to date versions of GTK+ and its dependencies.

Downloads can be found [here](http://lvserver.ugent.be/gtk-win64/).

Currently, all releases are compiled using GCC 4.8.1 (MinGW-w64 installed from TDM-GCC).
