GTK+ for Windows Runtime Environment Installer
==============================================

This repository is a fork of the  (GTK+ for Windows Runtime Environment Installer)[http://gtk-win.sourceforge.net] that was originally created
by Alexander Shaduri.
My efforts here will focus on creating a 64-bit version of the installer that he has been providing so far, using up to date versions of GTK+ and its dependencies.

Downloads can be found (here)[http://lvserver.ugent.be/gtk-win64/].
